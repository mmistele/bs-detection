Tower cranes have a large fixed base that is constructed on the ground, enabling them to operate at heights suitable for tall building construction [2].

Operators can change the boom angle vertically or rotate the boom to reach the job site. Provided they have sufficient operating height and lifting capacity, mobile cranes are generally preferred to tower cranes because they require less space on site, can be moved more quickly, and are generally less expensive to operate [3].  Mobile cranes are typically deployed for low-rise projects that do not require lifting within the building envelope.\n",

Abdelmegid et al. [1] also utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize the location of a single tower crane assuming fixed supply points to minimize hook time. Finally, Zhang et al. [9] developed a method to optimize the location of multiple tower cranes to minimize hook time. Each crane was responsible for servicing a particular set of supply and demand points. Utilizing hook time as a surrogate for cost, however, has certain limitations. First, it does not consider the type of crane used, which determines crane performance and cost [9].

Construction cost was assessed by multiplying the crane operating time by the equipment rental and operator labor rates. While Lien and Cheng’s approach includes a more comprehensive cost model compared to the methods discussed previously, it does not consider the interactions between the crane and crew at the demand point.

      "end of line\n",
      "Mobile crane planning typically involves the crane chassis moving with or without a payload. First, let’s consider when the crane moves without a payload. Al-Hussein et al. [11] developed an algorithm to optimize the selection of the type of mobile crane based on construction site requirements. The same authors later developed an improved method that optimized both crane type and the stop location considering the site condition and crane configuration [12]. Tantisevi and Akinci [4] developed a similar method that also considers the time required to set up and demount the crane at each stop. Finally, Manrique et al. [13] developed a method to optimize crane type, stop location(s), and the transportation sequence for building components to minimize construction duration and the amount of concrete used for the casting slabs. The method was applied to an example project involving the installation of 108 concrete panels for a residential building. The best solution found reduced the amount of concrete required for casting slabs by 14% compared to conventional industry methods. However, the all of the methods discussed above do not assess construction cost directly or consider the interaction of the crane with the installation crew at the demand point.\n",

Reddy and Varghese [14] use a configurations space or “C-space” to denote the start and end crane configurations, including the crane chassis location, the angle of the boom, etc. Two rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) with roots at the start and end configurations are generated to find the shortest connect path through a heuristic search method. The shortest connect path is the optimal crane path and operations. Lin [15] improved the heuristic search method by combing a sampling and an expansion technique, and also by developing a method to visualize the crane movements. Lei et al [16] developed a generic approach to check the feasibility of mobile crane path, and calculate the maximum and minimum radii for crane considering the crane capacity and configuration. Lei et al [17] used the algorithm developed by Al-Hussein [11] to illustrate how crane type would affect the optimal walking path of the crane. The objective of the optimization was to identify the crane-walking path that resulted in the minimum number of spatial conflicts with physical obstacles and ongoing construction activities.\n",

      "Four optimization runs were completed to compare the cost and schedule impact from considering crane and crew decisions in parallel versus sequentially. The first two runs optimized crane and crew decisions in parallel, one with the objective of minimizing construction time and the second with the objective of minimizing construction cost. Runs three and four had the same optimization objectives but considered crane and crew decisions sequentially. The variable configuration and resulting cost and schedule performance for each optimal design is presented in Table 4.\n",
      "end of line\n",
      "The solutions that minimize construction time are similar whether decisions are considered in parallel or sequentially: both use the more expensive deck crane, the highest number of crews (2), and the largest crew size (4 people). However, a diagonal panel installation sequence is employed when decisions are considered in parallel rather than horizontal sequence. Additionally, the optimal crane position was slightly different in each case. The diagonal sequence enables two crews to work in parallel when installing adjacent panels, which is not possible in the panels are installed in a horizontal sequence. Consequently, considering crane and crew decisions in parallel results in a 1.7% reduction in total construction time.\n",
      "end of line\n",
      "More significant differences are observed when comparing minimum cost solutions. Both solutions employ the minimum number of crews (1) and crew size (2 people). However, when decisions are considered in parallel, the optimal design solution employs a truck mounted crane instead of a deck crane (see Table 4). As a result, the total construction time is 0.7% higher, but the total cost is 16.3% lower due to the substantially lower crane rental cost. Upon inspection of the cycle times for crane and crew, it is apparent that crew speed is the limiting factor for nearly all panel installation cycles involving the deck crane, which negates any potential cost savings resulting from the use of a faster crane. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering crane and crew interaction when a cost optimal solution is desired.\n",

      "Regarding the solutions with the objective of minimizing construction time, the conventional practice solution shares the same crew configurations and crane type with optimal solution generated by the proposed method.

      "Regarding the solutions with the objective of minimizing construction cost, the crew size and number are identical for both conventional practice and the proposed method. However, the crane type, number of stops, and the installation sequence are different. Thus, the construction cost for conventional practice method is at most 41% higher than the proposed method.

All six decision variables impact the total time and cost of the panel installation process. The cost-time tradeoffs for all variable configurations considered are shown in Figure 7.

As illustrated in Figure 8, the deck crane results in a higher cost and a slightly lower installation time for all variable configurations, except for when one crew with four workers per crew is employed. In this case, the faster deck crane can reduce the installation time by a wide enough margin to more than compensate for the higher cost of this equipment.\n",
